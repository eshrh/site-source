<!-- Never is a person, or a deed, purely Sansara or purely Nirvana, never -->

Time is not real, Govinda. I have experienced this again and
again. And if time is not real, then the distance that appears to lie
between world and eternity, between suffering and bliss, between evil
and good, is also an illusion.
