title: Thoughts on probably my favorite anime ever, Legend of the Galactic Heroes
---

* Introduction
Recently, I finished 銀河英雄伝説 (ぎんがえいゆうでんせつ), or the Legend
of the Galactic Heroes (1988). It took me 312 days to finish for 110
episodes (47.5h)... needless to say, I took /a lot/ of breaks while
watching the show.

Still, while it definitely is a slow burn, I can pretty confidently
say that this is my favorite anime I've ever watched. It's truly
unique to the genre, as far as I've seen, in scale, narrative depth,
detail, and pure grandeur.

I can't recommend it enough.

I'll try my best not to spoil anything, but there are a few very light
ones.

* Production
Being an anime from 1988, the art-style is pretty distinctive compared
to the moe-brainrot-simple-shapes-degenerated-design I'm typically
used to watching. I'm not going to lie, I really didn't like it at
first, but somewhere around 20 episodes or so in, I started to enjoy
it. Looking back at it now, I can't imagine what I was thinking,
because I find the character design and visual detail (especially in
battle scenes) to be extremely beautiful.
** Art style
One thing I will mention though, is that I still only really like the
"classic" art style used in the show. On occasion, the art style
switches to a more modern, flat-ish style, that I assume is due to
either different art directors or different animation contracting.

the end/)

I vastly prefer the more detailed style, the lines are sharper,
characters are more emotive, and it's in general nicer to look
at. It's super jarring whenever they switch art styles, and sometimes
they use the newer style for episodes at a time. I didn't find it a
huge issue mainly because so few episodes are animated in the second
style, but it was something that bothered me a bit.

** Battles
I have to comment on how brilliantly done battle scenes, especially
the early ones are done. The art does a great job at conveying a sense
of absolutely immense scale of these literally galactic battles while
never losing focus on the individual ship, and the individual soldier.

2D ships being blown up has never looked this good. Shots of hundreds
of thousands of ship are balanced well by shots of the people
controlling them. Really three levels are used frequently. The
"control-panel" level which we spend the most time at, following
commanders looking at formation shapes on their dashboards. The second
is the ship level, where we typically see them blown up. The last
level, and the most detailed and shocking are the ones with nameless
soldiers. It's always a little jarring to go from these romantic shots
of commanders and their safety, to soldiers trying to collect their
intestines, getting impaled by iron struts, or electrocuted
.
** Alliance vs Empire design
In passing, I'd like to mention that I really loved the design
Alliance places, uniforms, and ship interiors. It contributes
massively to the masterful worldbuilding, and makes places and through
them, people and situations feel real and grounded to the planet,
area, and government.
*** Alliance
On the alliance side, design really hold a sense of the values the
Alliance stands for, like idealism, technology freedom, democracy, and
so on. The ships look futuristic and practical, using greens and
blacks, with dangerous looking spikes.

Alliance cities also look modern, with tall spires, glass,
and metropolitan design.

What I love about the design is it's consistency and depth. These
choices aren't skin deep, they pervade the interior of buildings when
we see characters inside them, and most importantly they actually play
a role in the world, affecting plot (I'd have to use some spoilers)
and feel incredibly real in a way that setting has never felt real to
me in anime before.

I find the ship interiors to be particularly special in this
respect. They're so remarkably unique that the perspective switching
that happens so often in the show is perfectly fluid.
*** Empire
The empire's designs focus on royalty, luxury, dignity, and
wealth. I'm a big fan of how much respect LOGH gives to buildings in
general. The construction of a new imperial palace is a great
undertaking, with architects, interesting characters, discussions, and
it also actually takes a lot of time, both in the show and in terms of
episodes.

I struggle to do it justice with just screenshots.

Of course the ships, uniforms, and ship interiors also match. It's
hard to capture in screenshots specifically because what's so special
about it is its consistency and grandeur. Reinhart's flagship later in
the show, the Schlossbrand, and Neue Sanssouci are some of my favorite
locations.

Whats also cool is that when one side manages to capture another
side's location, which happens *a lot*, they actually make that place
their headquarters. It's awesome to see different characters in the
same places, and how the interior of each place changes as a result of
decorations and portraits (suprisingly, art installations are a big
focus in interior shots) that the occupiers put up.
** Music
No review of this show would be complete without a mention of it's
fantastic music. Theme songs are changed after each big subarc, and
each of them are super fitting to their plot sequence.

My favorite OP would definitely have to be "Must be Something" by
Hitomi Konno. It's as rich and epic as the segment of the show it
plays in, the last 25 or so episodes.

My favorite ED is the second one, 旅立ちの序曲. I like how the ops
tend to be more focused on the Emipire, and the EDs give more
attention to Alliance characters.

In any case, past the theme songs I found the orchestral soundtrack
amazing, especially during battle scenes. They contribute to a sense
of scale during these really grand scenes that I really enjoyed.

* Thoughts on the plot
The narrative in LOGH is absolutely the bread and butter of the
show. It drives almost every moment of animation.

From a big-picture point of view, we see these two powerful
governments, the democratic Alliance and the oligarchic Empire. What
really draws us in though, are these two emerging generals, Yang and
Reinhart. Their stories and conflicts reflect the larger stories and
conflicts of their respective governments, and these reflect the
overarching conflicts of ideals and values.

** Characterization
In terms of characterization, LOGH is masterful in two respects. The
first is the buildup of an incredibly rich and fleshed out cast of
side characters.

Every character, on either side, has a definite purpose on the
galactic canvas. Each person is given a backstory, and a
conclusion. Reinhart's admirals stand out to me here, in which each
admiral is extremely distinct in their plot arcs, personality and
behavior.

LOGH has a huge cast in total, and each of the characters manages to
me beatifully unique, either visually, or by some idiosyncrasy, or by
some unique personality point that matters to the plot.

The two characters that LOGH spends its most time on are certainly Yang
and Reinhart. They end up being some kind of lenses into the values
they stand for.

Yang is the laid back character, unambitious to a fault. He sort of
recognizes the pointlessness and tragedy of violence while simultaneously
realizing, bitterly, the neccessity of large scale warfare. He holds
these contradictory views that mirror the contradiction in himself, in
that he's both a historian and a (reluctant) soldier.

He's obsessed with the grand picture, like the preservation of
freedom. A selfless individual working for the greater body, a symbol
of democracy.

Reinhart on the other hand, is the embodiment of ambition. He cares
about power on a much more personal level. This fact ends up being
both his greatest weakness as well as his greatest strength. He lives
for the thrill of the fight and the conquer.

Especially towards the end, Reinhart is sort of idolized in a kind of
Nazi fashion, as this kind of benevolent dictator working for the
benefit of their people through world domination. Other than this,
Yang and Reinhart are evenly matched in ability, and it leads to
fascinating interactions and developments.

** Pace
LOGH is a really slow show to be sure, but it never lacks energy. What
I mean is that while the plot is slow to develop, the audience never
forgets where they are, how they got here, and finds it difficult to
stop trying to predict where they're going.

There is a truly absurd amount of dialogue, political intrigue, and
military discussion. However, it's exactly this buildup that makes the
flashpoints, the battles, and the action so utterly exciting.

** Thoughtfulness
If I had to describe the core of LOGH in a word, it would be
"thoughtful."

It's really thoughtful in several ways. Mainly though, I say this with
respect to its discussion of political history and ethics. A big theme
throughout the show is the ambiguity of true justice with respect to
perspective. It's treatment of that topic is made possible only by a
deep, but equal characterization of people on both sides of a very
fundamental and historied conflict.

The main characters are exceptionally thoughtful. Both recognize the
faults of each others and their own governments, and both are
completely resolute in their own beliefs. To me, their actual
low-level tactics on the battlefield are cool, but not the focus of
the show.

Reinhart is a strong and capable leader, bringing about reforms,
progress, and social improvement with the speed and energy that only
one person in complete power could do. He realizes though, that the
dynastic method of the Empire's succession tradition mean that his
children or their children may not be as capable as him. This
thoughtfulness results in a deep conflict in his character that we
follow towards the end of the series, and without spoiling much, has a
profound outcome on the plot.

Similarly, Yang is also an extremely capable general and
leader. However, he's tied down by the bureaucracy and corrupt
politics of the Alliance's democracy. As an idealist though, he
refuses to align the military against his government, even when it's
clearly for the betterment of the people. Yang's thinking about
democracy, in its flaws and in its ultimate superiority in the grand
scheme is really interesting and the show spends a lot of time on
it.
