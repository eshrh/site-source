title: Overdue life update (2025 recap)
---

* Intro
With 2025 coming to a close, I thought I'd write up a sort of
free-form summary. These kinds of things are of course mostly for the
author's own self satisfaction, but I also do genuinely want to stay
connected to everyone interested in this site (and me), whether we're
close or have never met at all. If you talk to me regularly in person,
then there are some things you've inevitably heard from me; so I want
to pick and choose a few of them and keep everyone else updated too.

*** Cycling
As ~many~ everyone who knows me in person is aware by know, I got
into road cycling this year. In 2025 I cycled a bit over 3000km on my
bike, with really only one long distance trip on the Shimanami
Kaidou and the rest just around Tokyo and Yokohama. I bought my bike
off ジモティー, a second-hand sales website, late last year:

[[../images/2025_bike2.jpg]]

It cost me about $350 as pictured, which was probably too high with
all things said, but I immediately fell in love with the look of the
frame. It's a 2008 Lemond Poprad CX bike with fairly beaten up
parts. I knew pretty much nothing about road bikes when I bought it --
I literally didn't know how to shift up on the Shimano brifters when I
first got on. If I did, I would've noticed that the front shifter was
completely busted. Over the course of the next half year or so I
taught myself to service every part of my bike. Some new Microshift
shifters, all-new cabling and housing, new linear pull brakes to
replace cantilevers, new Campagnolo/Fulcrum wheels, new tires,
all-ultegra drivetrain (including the chain!) later, it looks
something like this:

[[../images/2025_bike1.jpg]]

I feel like bicycles are simultaneously magical and intricate but also
surprisingly foolproof and operationally obvious. I find this balance
of simplicity and technology extremely elegant, which is also why I
personally couldn't imagine using the new wave of electronic shifters
& derailleurs, or power meters, or hydraulic brakes. Not that I could
afford any of them anyway. Not too long ago I used to be a huge fan of
trains and loved taking them whenever I go anywhere, but these days I
have to come up with places to go just so I can hop on the bike. City
cycling, for all its risks and inefficiencies, is so thrilling and
liberating.

I happen to live quite close to the city, so areas like Shibuya,
Shinjuku, and Akihabara are all within around 10-15 km away. One of my
favorite pastimes is to bike over, eat some good food and watch the
people and cars for hours at a time. While the city is nice, another
area I love to cycle to is the series of artificial islands on the
south-east coast: Shinagawa/Oi wharfs, the south edge of Haneda
airport, all the Kawasaki industrial islands, and Daikoku. I am
generally fascinated by the logistics that make possible the modern
lifestyle we take for granted -- trains, airplanes, ships, but also
radio networks and manufacturing. I've collected a kind of amusing set
of photos from cycling through these areas which for the most part are
only conveniently accessible by car, and I plan to put them up on my
site somewhere. I also have quite a bit of cycling footage from a
action cameras, but editing them turned out to be way, way more effort
than I thought it would be. I should probably give up on Kdenlive (I
won't).

One special cycling trip was in March of this year, during which I
cycled the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishiseto_Expressway][Shimanami Kaidou]], a road connecting Onomichi in Hiroshima
with Imabari in Ehime. Most of the route has excellent bike
infrastructure is quite famously the ultimate cycling destination in
Japan. The views really didn't disappoint, I [[https://photos.esrh.me/albums/japan_2/][posted]] a couple photos
but something went horribly wrong with the color grading during
development and I didn't want to fix it in post. I travelled with some
very interesting people (mostly from the [[https://dicega.ng/][Dice ctf team]] and Zellic) who
were in Japan for SECCON. I made some awesome lasting friendships
(everyone comes back to Japan eventually) and it was all-around a
really great time.

*** School life
I've finished a bit over half of my Master's course at Science Tokyo
now, and I'd like to write a bit about how it's been.

From an educational standpoint, I find it difficult to recommend coming
here. The courses I've taken os far are in general exceedingly
superficial, easy, and exclusively busy work. I assume this is unique to
my department (Information & Communications (ICT)), but there's a
distinct culture of prioritizing research. To be honest though, I like
it much better this way. I have nothing but positive things to say
about my [[https://nishio-laboratory.github.io/member/nishio][supervisor]] and [[https://nishio-laboratory.github.io/][lab]]. I've been given all the resources I
could ask for and more, both in lifestyle and technological
terms. I'll discuss the details of the my research work in a different
section.

The campus and my office though, are really awesome. In the spring,
the pathway to the main building is flanked by cherry blossom trees:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class post-image
[[../images/2025_sakura.jpg]]

And in the fall, the main road is covered in yellow gingko leaves
(let's not talk about the rotting fruit):

#+ATTR_HTML: :class post-image
[[../images/2025_ichou.jpg]]

(My office is just off to the right).

One very funny course I took this year was "Getting familiar with the
Science Tokyo campuses" about each of the campuses of the (newly
merged) university and their surrounding areas. Each class took place
in a different campus and included a tour of the clock tower of the
main building. This class was really amusing; I wrote my final paper
as a ranking/review of ramen shops near the main (Ookayama)
campus (my top ranking was [[https://maps.app.goo.gl/9YLt4LFY3oJoYCCU7][なるめん]], I'd recommend visiting if you get
the chance, but you have to monitor the owner's X to figure out when
it's open).

For the most part, school was fun this year. There's a fairly large
population of foreign students from many countries, both exchange and
regular students. I live in a mostly international university dorm, so
I'm definitely interacting with more cultures than I ever have
before.

**** TraP
I'm a member of only one club, the [[https://trap.jp/][traP]] "digital creation circle", a
unified CS and digital art organization (which is also /by far/ the
biggest club on campus). Trap has a bunch of sub-clubs, like for game
dev, ctf, and competitive programming. Most of my (japanese) friends
are also in/from trap, and I keep up with them through an internal
discord-like chat app called [[https://github.com/traPtitech/traQ][traQ]]. The club has a lot of culture and
creative soul, and produces a suprising amount of output in the form
of code, games and miscellaneous projects. The only issue is that it's
essentially 100% japanese, and definitely leans more undergraduate in
composition.

I had the chance to compete in the ICPC Japan competition this year
with some foreign students from traP (@[[https://jp.linkedin.com/in/bohdan-parahailo][malfisto]] (my friend Bohdan),
and @[[https://atcoder.jp/users/Eraxyso][Eraxyso]]). I'm completely washed at competitive programming now
(not that I was ever really good), so I kinda just tagged along for
moral support. Out of 355 teams, /yamatonadeshiko/ placed 20th in the
country, but we still didn't qualify for the Yokohama regional since
we only placed 7th in the school. Science Tokyo was so strong this
year that all 4 teams that qualified full solved. It kinda inspired me
to start practicing again, and I've been working through the Japanese
CP book 「競技プログラミングの鉄則」on Bohdan's recommendation.

** Research
While being a regular student, I'm also employed as a research
assistant in our lab. So, I've naturally been somewhat focused on
research this past year.

The project I worked on for most of 2025 (which is now winding down)
is [[https://github.com/nishio-laboratory/latentcsi][latentcsi]], a method to generate images from Wifi CSI (a
record of the effects of the physical channel on signals transmitted
at various frequencies). To summarize the method, it adapts a
traditional Stable Diffusion type image to image process by replacing
the image-to-latent encoder with a different csi-to-latent neural net
that's trained to imitate the output of the original model with a
different input modality. This constituted one half of the work; the
other half implements this idea in real life, with distributed sensor
nodes, a training server, and clients. It turns out that using a
neural network to predict small latents instead of large images means
you can train it fast enough to show interestingly generalized results
in a few minutes and use it for nearly real-time inference. The [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10605][paper]]
contains more details, but I'd instead suggest browsing the [[https://github.com/nishio-laboratory/latentcsi/blob/master/docs/slides.pdf][slides]] for
a more concise summary.

To my great shock and horror, this paper got sort of popular on[[http://127.0.0.1:8001/posts/2025-11-15-year-recap.html][ a]] [[https://x.com/birdabo/status/1973014505878901154][few]]
 [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45434941][websites]], typically with people not really understanding the limits of
the work. Generalized learning off of raw CSI is very difficult, and
this isn't a problem we claim to solve. Instead, we try to find a
really lightweight solution that can be trained so fast that you can
learn new scenarios in a practical way. A short while after we put out
the arxiv paper, several companies contacted our lab interested in the
work, including worryingly some consumer technology companies. I can
say with some confidence that the industry is actively and eagerly
interested in abusing CSI sensing in quite concerning and directly
consumer impacting ways. This is real and might very well be coming
soon. Send me an email if you're interested in discussing more about
this topic. Sometimes it's quite easy to forget, when you're working
on an academic project, that what you do /does/ impact the real world
and can very well hurt people. It's seems quite clear to me that
pursuing this direction of research is somewhat morally compromised.

...anyway, I had the opportunity to do some (sponsored) travelling over
the past months to attend a few conferences. Travelogue follows:

*** Conferences
**** MIRU @ Kyoto
The first conference I attend this year was MIRU in Kyoto, the largest
domestic computer vision conference in Japan. This conference is huge:
there were at least a few thousand attendees, mostly composed of
students with an unexpectedly large cohort of undergrads. As I
understand, many undergrads present their senior-year thesis here.

Kyoto is of course only a short Shinkansen trip away from home, and a
city I've visited many times before. The highlight of the trip travel
wise was definitely the venue, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_International_Conference_Center][Kyoto International Conference
Center]]. This building is extraordinarily striking:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class post-image
[[../images/2025_kicc.jpg]]

It's designed in such a way that there are very few vertical lines at
all, and no vertical supporting columns. The famous Kyoto Protocol was
signed in the same main hall, and was a lot of fun to explore and
photograph.

**** Mobicom @ Hong Kong
In November, I visited Hong Kong for Mobicom 2025. Hong Kong was a
destination I'd wanted to visit for a long time, so I was very
excited. I stayed in the Kerry Hotel near Whampoa, which had excellent
food and a really spectacular view of the Hong Kong island skyline:


#+CAPTION: Carlsberg at the conference reception
[[../images/2025_hotel.jpg]]

I presented a demo of our real-time implementation of LatentCSI. I met
some very interesting people, students and professors alike. The final
day of the conference was held at the Hong Kong University of Science
and Technology (HKUST), a beautiful campus and environment. The
symposium presentations (which I managed to attend) were very
interesting.

This was my first time in officially-PRC territory, so I tried to make
the most of the trip. The very same day I landed I'd already hit most
of the big tourist spots, like the Avenue of Stars and the Peak. After
that, I kind of just wandered around Tsim Sha Tsui and Central either
trying to find famous restaurants or movie spots (my favorite of which
was the Central-Midlevels escalator from /Chungking express/). I'm a
big fan of Hong Kong cinema, especially Wong Kar-wai and the classic
Triad movies. While I did visit a couple of really good expensive
restaurants (especially for dim-sum), one of the most memorable things
I ate in HK was 車仔麪, or "cart noodles", where instant noodles are
mixed with the sauces and toppings of your choice. I'm sure I'd be
eating it every day if it was popular in Tokyo.

I took a day to visit Shenzhen, which is directly north of Hong
Kong. I'd read about a 5-day visa on arrival for the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone, so I decided without thinking too carefully to buy a
ticket for the HSR from West-Kowloon in Hong Kong to Futian in
Shenzhen. However, I'd unfortunately missed that the visa is only
available at direct ports of entry, namely the land-border crossings
at Luohu and Huanggang, the Shekou ferry port, and Bao'an airport --
/not/ any of the HSR stations. So here I am, at the immigration
counter to Shenzhen and the lady in charge looks through my passport
and asks me where my visa is, and I had to vaguely explain away my
horrific lack of research. The good news is that it's less than an
hour from West-Kowloon to the real land-border crossing, where I got
my 5-day visa and finally made it across.

Stepping into mainland China really feels like entering a different
world if you've never been there before. Everything's done slightly
differently, like the mobile payments, simplified Chinese, brands I've
never heard of before, delicious convenience store drinks, and above
all, the raw scale of buildings and public infrastructure. Luohu
station, the most popular land-crossing, is probably close to 10x
bigger in size on the Shenzhen size than on the HK side. I imagine
this sense of wonder is how many people feel when they visit Japan for
the first time (I'm so jaded now I can hardly remember it). My
favorite experience in Shenzhen was the Huaqiangbei electronics
market, a sprawling collection of buildings selling almost any
electronic product in any state of completion. When I was in high
school, I remember reading the [[https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/essential/essential-guide-shenzhen-web.pdf][Guide to electronics in Shenzhen]] book
for mysterious reasons, so it was cool to finally be there. The scale
and sprawl of the market was very impressive to see, since technology
has of course been a big part of my whole life. A common sight in
Huaqiangbei are groups of foreigners rolling around large suitcases
full of electronics (especially smartphones) buying hundreds of items
at a time to resell in regions like India and Western Africa. This
mirrors what you can see in places like Chungking Mansions (also of
/Chungking Express/ fame), where a large number of south asians
(mainly Indians and Pakistanis) run smartphone export businesses. I
also spent a bit of time in the Chungking Mansions while in HK, mainly
for the delicious and very authentic south Indian food, but also to
get a sense of this extremely weird and unique environment -- an
ostensibly poor piece of the Third World right in the middle of one of
the riches cities in the world. I highly recommend the book [[https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo11234886.html][Ghetto at
the Centre of the World]], which aptly describes this pattern as
"low-end globalization". I guess it's still surprising that the market
hasn't fully optimized electronics export out of China.

**** Globecom @ Taipei
In December, I attended Globecom held at the Taipei Internatinal
Convention Center. While it was my first time in Hong Kong, I
visited Taiwan for nearly 2 weeks in the summer. I stayed for about a
week in Taipei and another week in Kaohsiung. As such, I had a decent
idea of what I missed, what I wanted to do again, and what I should
advise my school friends to skip.

The main thing I missed was probably Yangmingshan park, with its
grasslands, cows, and hilly hiking routes:

#+CAPTION: Yangmingshan grasslands (entrance)
[[../images/2025_yangmingshan.jpg]]

In the same area I missed doing the hot springs at Beitou, but I did
get a chance to see the very cool old Xinbeitou train station. The
bulk of my trip was however, revisiting places I'd already been --
restaurants and food stalls. I absolutely love the kind of congyoubing
(scallion pancakes) that's served from streetside stalls -- I usually
ask for an egg and extra spicy sauce.

#+CAPTION: Congyoubing
[[../images/2025_congyoubing.jpg]]

When it's done right, it's incredibly flaky on the outside but soft
and chewy on the inside. My other top choice of street food is
hujiaobing (pepper buns), a slightly spicy meat bun from Fuzhou. For
dessert, I recommend xuehuabing (milky shaved ice), but it's probably
just as popular in the USA or Japan. I probably remember the night
markets in Taipei better than anything else from the trip -- I'd say a
trip to Taiwan is worth is just for the food (indeed there might not
be /that/ much else to do). We stayed fairly close
to Ximending station, and since our conference happened to coincide
with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Shan_King_Sacrificial_Ceremony][Qingshan king festival]] in Wanhua we got to see the whole
place lit up and packed with dancers and parade cars at every
intersection.

After all three of our presentations were finished, we took the
Maokong gondola up to Maokong station. While the weather was far from
ideal, the views from the gondola and the Taiwanese tea we shared at
the top were both fantastic.

* Looking forward
With that, I think I've covered my 2025 in fairly large strokes.  When
I look back on this year as a whole, two things stand out to
me. First, it felt quite dense, a fair bit of travel, very new
experiences, and new people coming into my life. But paradoxically, I
don't really have much tangible artifact to show for it! I didn't
learn as much as I might've hoped to, despite reading a lot; and
didn't make as many things as I would've liked to, despite programming
a decent amount. It's much harder to find value in experiences that
change you subtly and over time compared to individual events.

I've never been a big believer in new years resolutions, but there are
some trends I've felt recently that I hope carry on into 2026. One of
these is that I've returned to trying to learn Chinese (since ~3 years
ago). The last time I gave it a serious attempt, I decided to learn
traditional characters, which seriously limits the scope of content
you can immerse in. So, I ended up mostly doing a lot of vocabulary on
anki and not as much content immersion. This time around, I'm taking
it really easy on the anki, learning simplified characters (which
turned out to be much harder at all), and watching more
content. Still, I feel that compelling easy content for Chinese is
much harder to come by than for Japanese, for which you can pick and
choose from younger audience manga and anime popular and widespread on
the Western internet. My trips to the (Republic of) China, a (SAR of)
China and the (People's Republic of) China left a pretty strong
impression on me. I'd like to get to a reasonably conversational level
next year -- my standards and expectations are probably not going to
be as high as they were for Japanese.

I'm still enjoying programming in lisps, but I'd like to do more next
year too. The biggest thing I'm working on is a new static site
generator written in Racket. It uses scribble/html s-expression based
html templates, and will support really flexible transformation
pipelines (with a focus on ergonomic pandoc). I do like Hakyll, and
I've been using it for a long time now, but at some point I did come
to terms with the fact that it is just hard to "hack" on. Changing
anything that's not intentionally exposed (built-in) requires
hackage-reading and hoogling, it's impossible to monkey-patch
functions like we can do in lisp, and the templating system is
slightly awkward. I am essentially planning a hakyll-type SSG, with
the same structural philosophy about "contexts" and "compilers",
except dynamically typed (everything is a string), and much more
easily hackable. While I have a prototype working, getting it
feature-complete enough to totally replace both this blog and my
photos website has proved to be a bit more complicated. I am also
planning a total style/layout overhaul of both websites soon.

In any case, happy new year and holidays to everyone!! Here's to a fun and
fruitful 2026.
