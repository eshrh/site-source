title: 400 days in a row of spaced repetition
---

* Introduction
For nearly the past 2 years, I've been using [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Anki]] to learn several
things, primarily Japanese vocabulary. I've also used it temporarily
for a few memorization-oriented exams, and recently I've begun to
study Mandarin. While I started to use Anki seriously around May 2020,
my current streak only began at the top of 2021. In any sense, I've
had a pretty long relationship with the program, and I feel like I've
learned some valuable things other than a lot of Japanese words.

* Timeline
** 2020

I first found out about Anki and the spaced repetition idea around
March of 2020. To be honest though, I was still really toying around
with the idea of learning Japanese, and I didn't have any real sense
of the amount of commitment it would require of me for the next 2
years. I picked up the [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1237389412][2k/6k Core deck]] in May of 2020, and began to
regularly do repetitions. Further, I'd just entered summer break off
my junior year of high school, and I had a lot of time to sink into
this stuff. I started off doing ~100 cards a day for the first few
weeks, but I couldn't tell you how many new cards I was doing at
first. I do remember quite clearly trying to write every character as
I went, but I quickly gave up on it after I realized how much time
that would take up.

There must have been a certain point over that summer when I realized
the scope of what I was getting into, because i started to get
impatient and set my new card/day(NC/D) to 50. Of course, this bumped
up the number of reviews I was doing to around 400-500 a day. This
period of time probably involved the most struggle out of anything
I've had to do while learning Japanese. I think a lot of people who
are already deep into the CJ learning process forget how it feels to
have to parse and memorize these random lines and squiggles, before
your brain develops the pattern recognition machinery to break down
characters into their constituent radicals. I distinctly remember
thinking to myself that Anki felt like trying to carve your brain
into a very specific shape with a baseball bat. Needless to say, I got
extremely burnt out of Anki, like I can imagine a lot of eager
learners do with this program. The day I hit 2000 cards young/mature
on the Core deck, I quit. Well, not really, I thought I'd just take a
a break, maybe a day or two... and then the reviews pile up, and it
turns into a week to recover my usual number of reviews, and then a
month, and then you lose it entirely.

During this time, I started to immerse really heavily in anime,
movies, manga, youtube, and so on. I really bought into the idea that
after I memorized 2000 words, all I needed to do was understand
grammar and I'd be able to understand the general idea of mostly
everything. As you might imagine, I was extremely wrong, and it took
nearly two months for me to realize this. I don't think that those two
months were wasted, because the immersion certainly must have helped
somehow, but 2000 words simply isn't enough to get to where I could
start effectively "mining" words (adding words to anki from text
that you find in the wild). I realized this in december, and decided
to set myself against the Core deck again. I set all the cards I had
finished earlier to be infinitely mature, and began starting at 2000,
and continued until 2021.

** 2021

Unfortunately, I broke my streak right at the new year by getting
really into the Witcher 3. I still love the game, but at the time I
enjoyed it so much my Anki reps barely mattered to me. After putting
in over a hundred hours into the game on a single playthrough, I got
back on Anki to catch up on reviews.

This time, I would be in it for the long haul. I eventually finished
another 2000 words off the core deck, but I made a small but
significant change to the Core deck around the time I restarted it. I
made the cards /sentence-first/ instead of /word-first/. Essentially, i
would have to read the whole sentence instead of just one word before
flipping the card. This cost me a lot more time, but I realized that I
needed to absolutely maximize the amount of coherent Japanese I was
reading. If you're interested in doing this, you can do so pretty
easily by introducing some new css:

#+BEGIN_SRC css
#hiddenfuri ruby rt  {visibility:hidden;}
b{color:teal;font-weight:normal}
#+END_SRC

And then the front of your card becomes:

#+BEGIN_SRC css
<span style="font-size: 70px; font-family:IPAGothic;" id="hiddenfuri">{{furigana:Reading}}</span>
#+END_SRC

Maybe there was a better way to do this, but this worked for me.

At around 4.1k words off of Core, I began to notice that I was indeed
learning more valuable words from reading actual text than doing more
deck words. At this point, I turned off new cards from the core deck
for the last time. This time though, I wasn't really burnt out. I had
pretty much settled in for the grind, because I fully understood how
much more there was and had complete acceptance of it. For the rest of
the year and until now, my primary routine would be to read and enjoy
Japanese content, and add words I didn't know into anki and review
every day.

I believe I ended up adding around 3-4k words during the second half of
my senior year of high school and through the summer. While these
words were certainly important, I believe that what was more valuable
during this time was actually immersing in a lot of content, but I
think that's a topic for another post.

Over the summer, I began to get interested in another topics, and
supplemented Anki with a few miscellaneous decks. For instance, i
memorized [[https:ankiweb.net/shared/info/1036098926][counters]], [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1658750019][food]], [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2639768625][prefectures]], [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/888837927][poems]] and some other decks that might
have totaled to maybe 1k extra cards. I didn't keep a lot of these
cards, because I mostly matured them all and didn't want to have
clutter every day. I also got really interested in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_pitch_accent][pitch accent]] around
this time, which led to me adding pitch information retroactively to
my mining deck (using [[https://gist.github.com/eshrh/715482a3ff02723a9225e8f040069059][this script]] I wrote), and producing a new visual
sentence-level pitch accent deck you can find [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1928141023][here]]. I might discuss the rationale
behind the sentence-level pitch accent deck in a future post.

After the summer of 2021, I moved into university to study computer
science, which of course led to me putting Japanese on the back burner
for a while. In December, I began the whole process anew, with
Mandarin using a HSK Chinese vocab deck.

** 2022

I feel that using Anki for Mandarin for the first time was decidedly
easier than using it for Japanese back in 2020. I think this
attributable to several factors. First, I am very comfortable with
review sessions, Anki, and the prospect of lots and lots of
cards. However, I also already have the sinograph pattern recognition
and an instant recall of the meaning of various radicals and
symbols. This is helped a lot by the fact that I'm currently
memorizing traditional characters rather than simplified ones.

* Lessons learned
** Don't get scared by how much left there is
Anki is a fundamentally boring and repetitive activity. Pretty much
nothing you can do will change this. The repetition is literally
necessary to how the program is intended to work.

It's really, really, /really/ easy to start out and look at the 5,000
cards you'll have to memorize and lose all hope. I'd know, because
I've had this happen to me, several times over the past two years. I'm
not going to say something cliche like "live in the moment," but it's
essential that you learn to tune out the sense of impending review
pileup while you're actually reviewing. You have to selectively forget
that you still have X000 cards left to learn, or else you might never
get to think about that number in hindsight.

I'm not entirely sure what the best way to develop this kind of
"resilience against large numbers" is, and I'd be disappointed but
unsurprised if the only way is to actually crunch through them
yourself.

** Spaced repetition isn't magic, maximize patterns in content
What I mean by this is that your performance while doing spaced
repetition is significantly affected by many things. While this seems,
obvious, it's too easy to fall into the trap of thinking "if i put it
into SRS, i'll remember it!" (even if it might be true for a lot of
things).

A few months ago, I tried to memorize binary numbers -- a simple task
of going between decimal to binary and binary to decimal. After around
a month, I had a true retention rate of around 50%. I think the
problem was that there wasn't enough consistent pattern in the cards
for my brain to effectively pick out and learn.

This is why card design is so critically important, and why you should
almost always customize cards how you like them, and even better, make
cards yourself whenever you can. Learn to recognize when the
brute-force approach is not going to work and where you can optimize
for your brain's subconscious pattern recognition, which is almost
always more powerful than you realize. The key to this kind of
optimization is to ensure that cards have consistent, meaningful
patterns that are ideally connected to other cards, emotional
experiences, stories, or strong memories.

** Tips for good card design
*** Don't underestimate visuals
Pictures the brain finds cute,thrilling, exciting, or otherwise
emotionally engaging work wonders for memorizing cards
*** Use context, and force context if you must
Context is the most powerful way to optimize a card. Create context
arbitrarily if you really have to, while mining a card. Take a
screenshot of where you found the word, add a few lines about what it
meant in context, etc.
*** Minimize clues on the front
Cards with too much information on the front are bad because you'll
start to remember the back from irrelevant clues, rather than ones you
find in the real world when you need to recall. Think of this like
avoiding overfitting your brain.
*** Don't quiz yourself on too much
It's fine to include lots of information on the back of a card, like
pitch or frequency, but don't try to quiz yourself for correctness on
too much. For example, don't test yourself on recalling reading,
meaning, and pitch of word -- pick maybe one or two. You'll still
absorb into memory a lot of the other content anyway.
