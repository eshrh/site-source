* about this site
This website runs on Hakyll, with some build scripts written in my
customized scripting language, [[https://github.com/eshrh/matsurika][matsurika]]. You can find the source for
this website on [[https://github.com/eshrh/site-source][this repository.]]

Some extra files are hosted on this website. For instance, a [[../files/iosevka-meiseki-sans-regular.ttf][ttf copy]]
of my programming monospace font, a custom version of Iosevka ([[https://github.com/eshrh/nixos-config/blob/master/nixos/fonts/iosevka.nix][nix derivation]]).
